# App walkthrough:

## Sprint 1
“User can sign in to the website.”
- what technologies did we use?  (Carrierwave, Heroku for hosting, Devise for login)
- what was the biggest challenge?
- Challenges: being the only person with AWS access until we figured out the i/1 problem


## Sprint 2
User can see a list of airlines and click on them to see the posted reviews
User can enter a new airline.
Technologies: Foundation, explain linking to external images for airlines.


## Sprint 3
User can upvote/downvote other reviews.
User can enter a new review.
Get a data rejection, briefly say “this was our validation,”
Then get it right and see the newly added review.

The ‘why’ of the app.  Why did we create a airline rating app?

Air travel is stressful at the moment
Most websites review price, but comfort is also important!
